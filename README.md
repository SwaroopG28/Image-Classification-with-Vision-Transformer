# Image Classification with Vision Transformer

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for image classification tasks. Vision Transformers, which have recently gained popularity, apply the Transformer architecture—originally developed for NLP tasks—to image data, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.

## Key Features
- Utilizes the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model to perform image classification.
- Preprocesses image data for compatibility with ViT, including **patching** and **embedding** layers.
- Trains the ViT model on a classification dataset and evaluates its performance using standard metrics.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based models for computer vision tasks compared to CNNs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for implementing and training the Vision Transformer model.
- **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** for data handling and visualization.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of Vision Transformers in classifying images, offering an alternative to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks.
